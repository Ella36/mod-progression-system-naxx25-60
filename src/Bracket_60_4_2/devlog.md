- [x] Issue Bony Construct patrol/creature_formation guid 3612410
VMangos/CMangos show 5 points. No waypoints. 3 mobs wander with 15yd, 2 path
https://youtu.be/4UTQFrMRk5c?si=ye3fIhp7pg88f03C&t=5222 classic shows 4+2 pathing
ACore 25 shows 4+2 pathing

- [x] Issue Patchwerk Trash:
Creature formations of patchwork golems. Awkward pathing
Removed wandering from non-leader, but does not look correct
(361229, 361227, 10.8064, 306.6246666000065, 515, 0, 0),
(361229, 361228, 7.08383, 261.72081828001365, 515, 0, 0),
(361229, 361246, 6.33888, 349.3644533277902, 515, 0, 0),

potential upstream/acore fixes:
- [ ] Bombard Slime spell position is not random. Pos is pulled form spell_location template. Not present in acore, in VMangos/TC/CMangos from what I see
- [ ] Thaddius is stuck in position and does not move
- [ ] Lightning Totem does not aggro properly?
- [ ] Razuvious' Death Knight Understudy should switch between AttackReady (333) and Attack (36), out of combat RP missing
- [ ] Relinquery of Souls / Eye Stalk use OOC submerge spell // 28819 - Submerge Visual
implemented in TrinityCore: https://github.com/search?q=repo%3ATrinityCore%2FTrinityCore%20spell_reliquary_of_souls_submerge&type=code

# Editing 80 spells / custom spells
Workflow went like this:

Look in CPP or smartAI with Keira3 https://github.com/azerothcore/Keira3
what spellIds need changing

https://github.com/stoneharry/WoW-Spell-Editor
Import from DB (Mysql)
if using default DB. user root, password password, port 3306, db acore_world
import spells.dbc, create new spell 90000+ i.e. 90004
Edit attribute, save and use db viewer to export row id from `spell`

create second folder and open 1.12

2 WoW-Spell-Editors side by side to compare 335 and 112

create custom spell in 335 and match 1.12 values

Go to ./Export folder and grep `grep 90004 Spell.sql`

copy the query into `progression_60_4_2_naxx_spells.sql`

Change smartAI or cpp to use new custom spellID

## SmartAI CMangos 1.12
cmangos db,
cmangos core,
Database Editor smartAI -> write smartAI with Keira

## Exploring, comparing DBC Spells.
Editing/exporting did not work for me with SpellWork. I used WoW-Spell-Editor instead
https://github.com/azerothcore/SpellWork
extract to azerothcore-wotlk/env/dist/data and run .exe

## Spells
requires client patch?
detonate is still 10k
poison cloud damage is 3k
...
